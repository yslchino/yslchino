- 👋 Hi, I’m @yslchino
- 👀 I’m interested in learning a lot more about computer science (mainly c++ and python). Seeing projects and learning something new everyday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to merge my knowlegde of cars and some tuning and computer science. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any work, I think the more practice the better I will learn and understand.
- 📫 How to reach me message me for my discord @ysl_chin0
